            <p class="aboutPara">F1 is one of the most intriguing and demanding sports in the world. And yet Mercedes has managed to prevail in the sport and has become arguably its most dominant team. Thus, this powerhouse must have the professionals at the highest of their field, so that the team can function and run like clock-work to remain a pioneer, but also bounce back from losses. Therefore, I would be extremely grateful to obtain a work experience at such a prestigious company and learn more about it. Specifically I would like to gain hands on experience, network with the professionals at Mercedes AMG Petronas and learn about different career pathways into the field, as it is one that I aspire to be part of in the future (hopefully for Mercedes!).</p>
