            <h2 class="aboutTitle">Why I want this excellent opportunity and what I can gain from it</h2>
            <p class="aboutPara">Formula One is the most physically demanding and exciting sport in the world. And yet despite the extreme challenges in the sport, McLaren has managed to find its place as one of the greatest teams to have ever graced the sport. Nurturing Senna, Coulthard and arguably the best driver on the grid - Lewis Hamilton, McLaren has a deep history in the sport as being a team that produces greats. The same can be said currently for Lando and Oscar, who, despite their age, are managing to make strides for McLaren and are the most promising prospects by far. Therefore this team must be run by the highest professionals in the field across all departments. Therefore I would be extremely grateful if I could take part in a work experience with McLaren to see how this powerhouse of a team operates to constantly be performing at the highest standard in a sport where success is not easy. I hope to improve my technical skills (i.e. coding) but also my soft skills (like networking and communication) so that I can hopefully land a job with McLaren in the future!</p>
