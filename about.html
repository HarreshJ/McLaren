            <p class="aboutPara">Formula One is the <strong>most physically demanding and exciting sport</strong> in the world. And yet despite the extreme challenges in the sport, McLaren has managed to find its place as <strong>one of the greatest teams</strong> to have ever graced the sport. Nurturing Senna, Coulthard and arguably the best driver on the grid - Lewis Hamilton, McLaren has a <strong>deep history in the sport</strong> as being a team that produces greats. The same can be said currently for Lando and Oscar, who, <strong>despite their age, are managing to make strides for McLaren</strong> and are the most promising prospects by far. Therefore <strong>this team must be run by the highest professionals in the field across all departments</strong>. Therefore I would be <strong>extremely grateful</strong> if I could take part in a work experience with McLaren to see <strong>how this powerhouse of a team operates</strong> to constantly be performing at the <strong>highest standard</strong> in a sport where success is not easy. I <strong>hope to improve my technical skills (i.e. coding) but also my soft skills (like networking and communication)</strong> so that I can <strong>hopefully land a job with McLaren in the future</strong>!</p>
