            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Oscar Piastri is the youngest driver on the grid but is a living example that age is just a number. Being the only driver to ever win the Formula Renault, F3 and F2 in consecutive seasons, Piastri originally started his F1 career in (now called) Alpine but rapidly made his way into McLaren (the best team of course). Since then, Oscar has made strides for himself and the team. Most recently, Oscar managed to get his first win in Hungary this season which was extremely exciting and proved that his hard work is paying off!</p>
